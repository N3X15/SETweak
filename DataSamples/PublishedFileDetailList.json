		"description": "[b]Description:[/b] This is a vintage version of Fighter Cockpit, with old textures and buildstate models before it was injected into vanila game. I left it here because of legacy option, and for people who don't like new textures and reduced buildstates for some reason.\r\n\r\nThis is a LEGACY mod. That means it is here for purely historical accounts. I will not update model to accomodate to any future changes of the gameplay, as of it is already in Vanila and updated.\r\n\r\nCheck my [url=http://forums.keenswh.com/post/6697919]thread[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Current Function:[/b] Functional\r\n\r\n[b]Planned Function:[/b] Cockpit\r\n\r\n[b]Available on:[/b] Small ships\r\n\r\n[b]Adapted for Survival:[/b] Yes\r\n\r\n[b]Polygons:[/b] 3000",
